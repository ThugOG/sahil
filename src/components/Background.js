                <p>I am a undergrad studing in <span>Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering & Visual Arts for Bachelors in Engineering</span>, Computer Engineering</p>
                <p>As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design-combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>
